This is a online shopping cart application 
===========================================
This was built with React JS frontend with JSON objects. This JSON array object currently added within the project;
That can be replaced with API's for realtime application.

The apis can be build with ASP.NET Core APIs

This fontend applicatoin doenst have the API instead used JSON array defined in the cartReducer.js files

That also can be seperated with db.JSON file but; I included it in that cartReducer.js
